=====

Argus is a time series monitoring and alerting platform.  It consists of discrete services to configure alerts, ingest and transform metrics & events, send notifications, create namespaces, and to both establish and enforce policies and quotas for usage.

It's architecture allows any and all of these services to retargeted to new technology as it becomes available with little to no impact on the users.
